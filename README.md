ketosense
=========

An Arduino ketosis detector.

This is the source-code for an Arduino controlled breath acetone detector. The purpous for the instrument is to detect if a person is in a metabilic state called ketosis. The instrument uses an electrochemical gas sensor called TGS822.

A digital temperature and humidity sensor called DHT22. A 2x16 char LCD display and is powered by an Arduino Uno board.

This version is developed by members of the Gold Coast TechSpace and is based on http://jenslabs.com/category/electronics/ketosis-detector but heavily modified to support more modern sensors, smaller form-factor and network connectivity.
